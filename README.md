In response to the issue raised on the final assignment
https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-r/discussions/forums/NgtEXon6EeyuXhKZwQM4Iw/threads/8Mw8ZJGBEe-EehJBvsVd1Q
and at the suggestion of Geetika Pal, I have uploaded my Jupyter notebook for review.

The warnings and errors are:
cell 1: “package ‘tidymodels’ is not available (for R version 3.5.1)”
cell 2: Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘tidymodels’ in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]):
 namespace ‘rlang’ 0.4.5 is already loaded, but >= 1.1.0 is required
cell 5: Error in read_csv("noaa-weather-sample-data/jfk_weather_sample.csv"): could not find function "read_csv"
